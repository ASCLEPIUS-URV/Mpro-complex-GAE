# Mpro-complex
The file "Complex_MPro_DB_Data.mat" contains 107 M-pro crystallized structures bound to an 180 inhibitor for which its pIC50 is known. These ligands were obtained through FRAGALYSIS https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/react/preview/target/Mpro. The file "Activity.mat" contains additional ligand complexes obtained from The Protein Databank (PDB). Each instance consists of graph describing the whole ligand and only the atoms and bonds of the protein that are close to some atom of the ligand. Specifically, at a distance lower than seven Angstrom. Graph nodes are atoms of both, the ligand and the protein. Attributes on the nodes are the three-dimensional positions of the atoms that represent and their atomic number. Edges are unattributed and the generated graphs have 123 nodes in the basic set and 144 in the extended set. 'Activity.mat' contains the ligand pIC50 values.
